```javascript
// Example using Tailwind's @apply directive
<button class="@apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```
This code might unexpectedly produce unexpected styles or even no styles at all if the `@apply` directive isn't properly configured or if there's a conflict with other CSS rules.  The `@apply` directive is processed during the build step and might be affected by changes to Tailwind's configuration or other CSS that's included.

Another uncommon issue can arise from improperly configured `purge` or `content` options in `tailwind.config.js`. If the directives aren't configured to properly scan your templates and components, Tailwind may remove styles it believes to be unused, unexpectedly removing important CSS from your application.
