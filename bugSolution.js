// Solution for the @apply issue:
// Ensure that your Tailwind configuration is correct and that your templates are properly scanned. 
// For example: Check if you have properly added the base, components, and utilities to the content option in your tailwind.config.js

// Solution for purge configuration issues:
// Ensure your `tailwind.config.js`'s `content` option includes all the necessary paths to your HTML, JSX, or other templates.  For example:
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
}

// Solution for CSS conflicts:
// Use Tailwind's utility-first approach or write more specific CSS rules to override conflicting styles. Ensure you correctly understand the specificity rules of CSS and prioritize your styles using the appropriate specificity level.
